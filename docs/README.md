# Welcome to PyApple!

PyApple is a simple python library for fetching IPSWs, MacOS builds, or helping you when you are working with some SHSH2 / Img4 / IPSW stuffs. 

## Caution

Note that some functions would not be working on Windows platforms due to idevicerestore / libmobileidevice stuffs. 

We highly recommend to use jailbreaking, Img4 decoding stuffs on Unix-based (Linux, MacOS) environments.
